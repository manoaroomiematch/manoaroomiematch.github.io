## Overview

### The problem
Every semester, hundreds of UH Mānoa students struggle to find compatible roommates—whether in the dorms (Hale Aloha, Gateway, Frear) or in off-campus apartments. This issue is amplified by the fact that approximately 31% to 36% of the UH Mānoa student population comes from out of state, meaning a large portion of students arrive in Hawaiʻi without established local connections or housing arrangements. Students commonly report conflicts due to mismatched sleep schedules, noise preferences, cleanliness expectations, guest habits, or study routines. Without a structured way to evaluate compatibility, students rely on random Snapchat and posts, word-of-mouth searching, or even dating apps, often resulting in stressful living situations, roommate conflicts, and frequent room switches.

There is currently no UH-focused platform that helps students understand whether they are compatible *before* committing to live together.

### The solution
**Mānoa RoomieMatch** provides UH students with a personalized, AI-enhanced roommate matching experience. Students log in and create a lifestyle profile covering sleep routines, cleanliness standards, study habits, noise tolerance, guest expectations, cooking frequency, personality traits, and budget/space preferences.  

The system compares profiles to generate a compatibility score, along with an AI-generated explanation describing areas of alignment and potential conflict. Students can browse matches, view detailed comparisons, and reach out to peers they’re compatible with.

In addition, the system can generate AI-assisted communication templates, personalized housing advice, and conflict-prevention tips based on the student’s preferences.

## Approach

Once a student creates their lifestyle and housing profile, the system stores their preferences and makes them available for matching.

### User Flow
1. **Login and Profile Setup:**  
   Students log in using UH email authentication and complete a structured lifestyle questionnaire. Preferences include sleep schedule, cleanliness level, social habits, noise tolerance, personality, study style, daily routines, and housing goals.

2. **Match Browsing:**  
   Students browse potential roommates filtered by preferences such as major, budget, dorm choice, lifestyle habits, and shared interests.

3. **AI Compatibility Evaluation:**  
   The system uses AI to:
   - Analyze two profiles  
   - Generate a compatibility score  
   - Provide strengths, conflicts, and suggestions  
   - Create tailored “first message” templates to contact matches  

4. **Notifications (optional stretch):**  
   Students can receive notifications when new profiles appear that meet their criteria.

5. **Admin Functions:**  
   Admins can:
   - Flag inappropriate content  
   - Create new lifestyle categories  
   - Manage and review profiles  
   - Adjust system presets (e.g., default survey questions)
